      <h1>Sound Circuits</h1>

      <p>
        Sound Circuits is a bi-weekly meetup for you to come work on your DIY
        music projects. It’s easier to make progress on side projects if you
        have a structured time to show up and work on them. We have extra
        tools, space to work, and like-minded people you can hang out with and
        learn from.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can work on any music-related project you want here. Making pedals,
        fixing equipment, building synthesizers, programming Arduinos to make
        sound, soldering cables, designing a new instrument from the ground
        up–these are just a few examples of great things to do here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          We welcome everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
          disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
        </em>

      <h2>I need a project!</h2>

      <p>
        Here are some places where you can buy DIY kits/projects to work on.
        The list is loosely ordered from cheapest to most expensive. Price
        ranges given don’t necessarily include ordering the electronic parts,
        although some kits already have them all included.
      </p>

      <h3>DIYRE</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/"
           target="_blank">DIYRE</a> sells really useful DIY recording kits.
         Everyone needs some <a
           href="https://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/collections/for-beginners/products/ferrite-di?variant=1025320372"
           target="_blank">DI boxes</a> - that’s a cheap and simple project to
         start with. They also have cool Colour 500-series modules that you can
         use for adding vibe to your tracks.
      </p>

      <h3>Build Your Own Clone</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://buildyourownclone.com/" target="_blank">BYOC</a> is a
        classic spot to pick up effects pedal kits for cheap. They are
        relatively simple to build, and sound great. Almost any effect you can
        think of, they probably have a kit for it. They also have good sales to
        watch out for. Their <a
        href="https://buildyourownclone.com/collections/beginner-packages/products/confbooster"
        target="_blank">Confidence Booster</a> kit is only $15, and is a perfect
        intro to soldering.
      </p>

      <h3>Arduino</h3>
      <p>
        Pick yourself up an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"
          target="_blank">Arduino</a>, and start learning to program and build
        hardware. There are a ton of <a
          href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/tags/music"
          target="_blank">music projects</a> that you can follow to teach
        yourself more and more skills.
      </p>

        tons of designs and projects on his <a
          href="http://musicfromouterspace.com/" target="_blank"
        >Music From Outer Space</a> website and
        has educated folks for decades. Unfortunately, he passed away from
        cancer in 2016, but Synthcube has taken over distributing his kits in
        his absence. There are <a
          href="http://synthcube.com/cart/music-from-outer-space/mfos-single-board-analogue-synths"
          target="_blank">single-board analog synths</a> in the $30-60 range,

        href="http://www.cs80.com/crowminius/" target="_blank">Crowminius</a>,
        a Minimoog clone that fits in a small attache case. For the truly bold,
        build an <a
        href="https://cs80-com.myshopify.com/products/crowbx-eight-voice-backplane-bare-pc-board"
        target="_blank">8-voice Oberheim OB-X rackmount clone</a>. The PCB boards
